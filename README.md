# imageProcessingCpp

This project contains 4 image processing methods written in C++ using OpenCV library, histogram equalization, entropy filter, image openning and morphologic thickening. First two works on RGB and grayscale images, third one on binary and morphological. Inbuilt functions are used only to read, write images and take colors of chosen pixels. There is implementation of somekind of menu in main function, so if you want to use it, just clone it, choose in image, number of operation and go ahead :)
